Welcome to Cult de Poisson's first official devlog! Through these, we hope to share sneak peeks of various features we've been working on, and let you in on our process.

## GOD RAYS & BIOLUMINESCENCE
Developed by one of our programmers, Harry, “god rays” and bioluminescence were implemented with the intention of giving our oceans a sense of wonder. They are implemented via Unity's particle system, which can be modified to give the glow directionality. Bioluminescent particles were implemented using both Shader Graph and the particle system.

## CONCEPT ART
Before 3D artists can begin sculpting, our concept artists bear the responsibility of designing the element, whether it be a collectable, fish, environmental prop, or character! Here are a couple of our favorites from the past few weeks:

Of course, we can't give too much context... no spoilers here!

## The Journal
And last but certainly not least, here's the 3D model for the player's journal! This is instrumental to gameplay and progression.
